# GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH

A program that allows the user to search books and either view them at the google store or save them for later. The program utilizes the Google Books API to gather information of the books searched like the title, author(s), and a brief description. The user is also able to save book to the mongoose database for later which there they can also remove from the save section of the database.

## USAGE 

Once on the webpage the user is able to view random books for them to look at, but they are also able to search for their own books through the search bar. The user can search any title of books and the will receive the most relevant books to their title of choice. The user will then have an option to view the google store and purchase the book or they can save the book to the mongoose database.

The second part of the website is the save function where a user can view the
their saved books to view in store or remove them fro the list.
